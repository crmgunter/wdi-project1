# wdi-project1
games project


Hangman consists of an alphabet field, a game board, and an answers section.
The game picks a random word for the user to guess.
There is a container of buttons which display a letter of the alphabet.
When the user clicks a letter, the button is disabled and it either displays that letter in 
its place in the mystery word or a "life" is subtracted and a body part is added to the stickfigure.
The user has 6 chances to get the correct word.
If the user guesses the word before they run out of tries, they are given a notification that they have won the game.
If the user does not guess the word in 6 tries, they are notified of a loss.
